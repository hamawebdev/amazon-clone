<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

> Amazone is a clone of the amazon website, which I created by following
> SuperSimpleDev's JavaScript course. I'm studying a course to enhance
> my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and advanced patterns,
> while acknowledging that I do not have full ownership of this content.
> This website is derived from the course's author and from my personal
> code optimizations and refactorizations.
